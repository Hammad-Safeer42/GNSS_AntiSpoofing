# GNSS_AntiSpoofing
Implements a GPS anti-spoofing technique using a 2Ã—2 antenna array. Detects spoofed signals by estimating their spatial subspace without full code/Doppler search. Leverages the high spatial energy of spoofed PRNs from a single-source attacker to separate them from authentic signals.
